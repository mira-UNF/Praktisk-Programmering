Test Creation -  vector u = (2,1,1) and vector v = (1,2,1)

Test Addition - vector w = u+v = (3,3,2) - test passed? - True

Test Inversion - -u = (-2,-1,-1) - test passed? - True

Test Subtraction - w = u-v = (1,-1,0) - test passed? - True

Test Constant Multiplication - w = 2*u = (4,2,2) and w2 = u*2 = (4,2,2) - test passed? - True

Test Dot Product - v dot u = 5 - test passed? - True

This should output 2,1,1 - it outputs 2 1 1
