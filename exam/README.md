This folder contains my exam project for the practical programming and numerical methods course. I had number 28 in the spreadsheet and have thus completed exercise 28. The exercise description can be found below as well as my interpretation of it.



Least-Squares Signal Extrapolation
-------------------
Least-squares signal extrapolation (linear prediction)
Introduction
Least squares method can be used to find patterns (correlations) in a signal which can then be used to extrapolate the signal (see the lecture note).

Task
Implement a function with the signature
vector predict(vector x, int n)
that takes the signal vector and the number of terms as input and returns the vector of coefficients that can be used to extrapolate the signal using the "linear prediction" formula,
