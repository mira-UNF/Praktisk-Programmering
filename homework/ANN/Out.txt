---------------------------PART A-------------------------------
This tests a simple neural network based on Newton minimisation
It is implemented using an analytical gradient approach
The graph for part A can be found in plot_A.png
Here the circles are the training data and the solid line is the network response


---------------------------PART B-------------------------------
The neural network can also output derivative, double derivative and anti derivative responses
