---------------------------PART A-------------------------------
This tests a simple neural network based on Newton minimisation
It is implemented using a numerical gradient approach
The graph for part A can be found in plot_A.png
Here the circles are the training data and the solid line is the network response

PS - I could not get the analytical to work, but a quasi-newton worked fine, hope it is ok


---------------------------PART B-------------------------------
The neural network can also output derivative, double derivative and anti derivative responses
The different derivatives can be found in the graphs named plot_deriv.png, plot_dderiv.png etc.
The normal function can be found in plot_B.png
Again the circles are the data points/tabulated values and the solid line is the network response
