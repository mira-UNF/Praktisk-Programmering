-----------------------PART A-------------------------
The unit circle area integration error can be found in unit_circle.png, the solid line is the estimated error, the dotted line is the actual error
The difficult singular integral should evaluate to approx 1.3932039296856768591842462603255
The MC integrator evaluates it to be 1,40736976615562 with an error of 0,0418875185202106 and 4000 points
---------------------PART B---------------------
The comparison between the plain and quasi random MC integration can be found in comparison.png
The solid line is 1/Sqrt(N) and the dashed line is the quasi random method
